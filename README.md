After i finished reading [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/), i have learned alot about being a good developer and here what i learned so far:

1. **Your Project's purpose**, make sure you find a purpose and a goal for your project. 

2. **Simplicity**, make sure to write a simple and easy-to-understand code, so you or your teammates won't get *frustrated* about what you wrote! And ***if your project has complex codes***, just add comments to explain them.

1. **Keep your project up-to-date**, your project should be maintained and be updated periodly.

1. **Develop your problem-solving skills**, as a developer, you will face new challenges everyday, maybe annoying bugs.

5. **Don't start big!** make it small, then expand it!

6. If *your client* wants changes, **you should** make these changes.

1.  **Keep learning!** don't stick with one programming language or with one platform, try to learn more languages! Use more platforms!

1. If you get confused, **ask for help!**

And keep in mind, ***DON'T EVER LEAVE CODING!***

Have a nice day! :)
